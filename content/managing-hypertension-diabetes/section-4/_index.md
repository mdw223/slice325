## Risk Factors for Falls

Several risk factors contribute to an increased risk of falls in clients with hypertension and diabetes:

Nerve damage, often affecting the feet, reduces sensation and coordination

### 3. Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)
Can cause dizziness, confusion, and weakness

### 4. Medication Side Effects
