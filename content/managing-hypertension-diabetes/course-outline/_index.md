### Section II: Understanding Hypertension and Diabetes
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against the walls of the arteries is consistently too high.

### Section III: Nutrition and Diet for Hypertension and Diabetes
A balanced diet plays a crucial role in managing hypertension and diabetes. For hypertension, reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium and fiber consumption can help control blood pressure. For diabetes, a focus on carbohydrates, fat, and protein management, along with meal planning and portion control, can help maintain blood glucose levels within a healthy range.
