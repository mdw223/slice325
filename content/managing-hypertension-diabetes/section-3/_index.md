# Section II: Understanding Hypertension and Diabetes

## Definitions

### Hypertension
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against the walls of the arteries is consistently too high.

- **Normal blood pressure** is generally considered to be 120/80 mm Hg or below
- **Hypertension** is typically defined as a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher

### Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose levels. There are two main types of diabetes:

- **Type 1 diabetes** is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

- **Type 2 diabetes** occurs when the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use it effectively.

## Causes & Risk Factors

### Hypertension
Hypertension can be caused by a variety of factors, including:
- Genetics
- Age
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Smoking
- High sodium intake
- Certain medical conditions such as kidney disease

### Diabetes
Diabetes risk factors vary depending on the type.

**Type 1 diabetes** is primarily influenced by:
- Genetic factors
- Environmental factors

**Type 2 diabetes** risk factors include:
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity
- Age
- Family history
- High blood pressure
- Ethnicity

Additionally, certain medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and prediabetes, can increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

## Symptoms & Complications

### Hypertension Symptoms
- Hypertension often has no noticeable symptoms, which is why it's sometimes called the "silent killer."

- Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to severe complications, including:
  - Heart attack
  - Stroke
  - Kidney disease
  - Vision problems

### Diabetes Symptoms
Diabetes symptoms may include:
- Increased thirst
- Frequent urination
- Extreme hunger
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue
- Irritability
- Blurry vision
- Slow-healing sores
- Frequent infections

### Diabetes Complications
If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to complications such as:
- Heart disease
- Stroke
- Kidney disease
- Nerve damage
- Foot problems
- Vision problems
